<h1><strong> HORSE </strong></h1>
<h2><small>Equus caballus </small></h2>
<p> <i> Horses have oval-shaped hooves, long tails, short hair, long slender legs, muscular and deep torso build, long thick necks, and large elongated heads. The mane is a region of coarse hairs, which extends along the dorsal side of the neck in both domestic and wild species. </i></p>
<p>The teeth are specialized for grazing, with cheekteeth that are complex and grow continually. Thick, winter coats start developing in September and October, are fully grown by December. Winter coats begin to shed in the spring and summer coats are more sleek and thin.

Domestication of horses has led to wide variation in the characteristics of breeds of horses. Coats vary in color, from white to black and including reds, browns, and yellows, as well as a wide variety of patterns, such as spots and pinto patterns. Size can vary depending on the breed, but can range from 227 to 900 kg in mass and 0.9 to 1.7 meters in height.

<p>The horse is an animal belonging to the family of Equidae and class Mammalia. Horse definition also states it is a large herbivorous domesticated mammal, with a beautiful flowing mane, and solid hoofs. It belongs to the subdivision of species Equus ferus that is subspecies Equus ferus caballus. This subdivision of species caballus is not necessarily wild rather they are free-roaming feral horses.

<p>Horses are used for many purposes by humans, especially to carry the load. In fact, people implement selective breeding methods for the production of horse breeds bigger than the ones naturally bred for doing heavy work. North America is the origin of horses and then spread across Asia and Europe. Horse species were earlier used for wars and battles. And now mostly for racing and riding. </p>	
<p>Horses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive markings, described by a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex.[42] Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings,[43] which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.</p>
<p>Many genes that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified. Current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color,[45] and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits. The basic coat colors of chestnut and black are determined by the gene controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor,[46] <br>also known as the "extension gene" or "red factor,"[45] as its recessive form is "red" (chestnut) and its dominant form is black.[47] Additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as greying, and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses.[45]</p>
