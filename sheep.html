<h1><strong> SHEEP </strong></h1>
<h2><small> Ovis aries </small></h2>	
<p>sheep, (Ovis aries), species of domesticated ruminant (cud-chewing) mammal, raised for its meat, milk, and wool. The sheep is usually stockier than its relative the goat (genus Capra); its horns, when present, are more divergent; it has scent glands in its face and hind feet; and the males lack the beards of goats.</p>
<p><i>Sheep usually have short tails. In all wild species of sheep, the outer coat takes the form of hair, and beneath this lies a short undercoat of fine wool that has been developed into the fleece of domesticated sheep. Male sheep are called rams, the females ewes, and immature animals lambs.</i></p>
<p>Mature sheep weigh from about 35 to as much as 180 kg (80 to 400 pounds). To browse sheep by breed, see below.</p>
<p>A sheep regurgitates its food and chews the cud, thus enabling its four separate stomach compartments to thoroughly digest the grasses and other herbage that it eats. The animals prefer grazing on grass or legume vegetation that is short and fine, though they will also consume high, coarse, or brushy plants as well. They graze plants closer to the root than do cattle, and so care must be taken that sheep do not overgraze a particular range. Sheep are basically timid animals who tend to graze in flocks and are almost totally lacking in protection from predators. They mature at about one year of age, and many breed when they reach the age of about one and a half years. Most births are single, although sheep do have twins on occasion. The lambs stop suckling and begin to graze at about four or five months of age.</p>
<p>Domestic sheep differ from their wild progenitors and among themselves in conformation, quantity and quality of fleece, colour, size, milk production, and other characteristics. Most breeds of domesticated sheep produce wool, while a few produce only hair, and wild sheep grow a combination of wool and hair. Several hundred different breeds of sheep have been developed to meet environmental conditions influenced by latitudes and altitudes and to satisfy human needs for clothing and food. Breeds of sheep having fine wool are generally raised for wool production alone, while breeds with medium or long wool or with only hair are generally raised for meat production. Several crossbreeds have been developed that yield both wool and meat of high quality, however. Of the more than 200 breeds of sheep in the world, the majority are of limited interest except in local areas.

<h4>Characteristics of Sheep:</h4>
<ul style=list style type="disk">
<li>Domestic sheep differ in many ways from their wild relatives and ancestors, having been uniquely neotenic as a result of human selective breeding.</li>
<li>Some of the features of the wild sheep, such as short tails, are preserved by a few primitive sheep breeds too.</li>
<li>Wild sheep are predominantly variations of brown hues, and there is very little variation between species. The domestic sheep's colors vary from pure white to dark brown chocolate, and even spotted or piebald.</li>
<li>Sheep exhibit a variety of heights and weights, depending on the breed. A heritable characteristic that is frequently selected for inbreeding is their rate of growth and mature weight.</li>
<li>Sheep weight: Ewes(adult female sheep) usually weigh between 45 and 100 kilograms and grams(adult male sheep) weigh between 45 and 160 kilograms.</li>
<li>The sheep have 20 teeth when all the deciduous teeth erupt. There are 32 teeth for mature sheep. The front teeth in the lower jaw, as with other ruminants, bite into a smooth, toothless pad in the upper jaw.</li>
<li>Sheep have excellent ears and are sensitive to noise.</li>
<li>Sheep have horizontal slit-shaped pupils sheep can see behind themselves without turning their heads with excellent peripheral vision.</li>
<li>Many breeds have only short hair on the face, and some have facial wool confined to the stud and mandibular angle area.</li>
<li>Sheep have a poor sense of depth; shadows and dips in the soil can cause sheep to balk.</li>
<li>Sheep also have an outstanding sense of smell, and they have scent glands just in front of the eyes and interdigital on the paws, like all members of their genus.</li>
